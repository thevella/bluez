This fork extends the input profile with input device support. now the profile can listen to
BT input devices while presenting itself as an input device to other host machines.

added to input.conf
InputDeviceProfileEnabled=[true/false]
InputDeviceProfileSDPRecordPath=[path to sdp record xml file]

after connection with input host machine is established the profile adds a dbus interface 
org.bluez.InputHost1 to the device object, which contains the names of ctrl and intr channel
sockets. 

if you connect to intr socket and white hid reports, those will be transmitted to the host

CaptureUHIDChannelsForInputDevices and ExclusiveCaptureOfUHIDChannelsForInputDevices allow 
to create similar sockets to capture bluetooth devices communications, possibly exclusively 
(bypassing machine)

Examples folder contains a working example of a python gateway, which connects to input profile 
sockets for input devices and hosts and transmits messages both ways. E.g. Key remapping can happen
in such gateway

============

Note that changes are made in the 'changelog' branch, this is where development happens.
Changes are then cherry-picked and squashed on the master branch to make it easier to
rebase on upstream branch.
